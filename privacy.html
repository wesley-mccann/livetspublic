      <h1>Privacy Policy for FM3LiveTS</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 26, 2023</p>

      <p>
        This privacy policy describes how FM3LiveTS ("we", "our" or "us")
        collects, uses, and shares information in relation to our mobile
        application ("App"). Please read the following to understand our
        practices regarding your information and how we will handle it.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Given the nature of our App, we do not collect, store, or share any
        personal data from our users. The only function of our App is to open a
        webpage.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Third-Party Web Content</h2>
      <p>
        Our App directs users to a webpage. This webpage may have its own
        privacy policies and terms of service that are independent of our App.
        We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such
        third-party webpages. We encourage users to be aware when they leave our
        App and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that
        collects personally identifiable information.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make any
        material changes, we will notify users through the App, or by other
        means, to provide an opportunity to review the changes before they
        become effective.
      </p>
